# Rapid Prototyping Pipeline

The amount of time it took for me to build the first version of the usable application was just 2 days from conceptualisation of the idea to deployment. This was my first time development of a usable application.Streamlit is a must know tool for all python based Data App developers.

### Heroku deployment

# To Do

> 2. Add description on how to interpret the graphs
> 3. Structure the analysis based on a narration (!)
> 4. Named Entity Analysis
> 5. Correlation (?) (But how?)
